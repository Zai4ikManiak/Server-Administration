# Descriptions of current nftables families:

| Family | Description | Equivalent tool |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `ip` | Tables of this family see IPv4 traffic/packets. | `iptables` is the legacy x\_tables equivalent. |
| `ip6` | Tables of this family see IPv6 traffic/packets. | `ip6tables` is the legacy x\_tables equivalent. |
| `inet` | Tables of this family see both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic/packets, simplifying dual stack support.</br></br>Rules for L4 do not affect simultaneously both IPv4 and IPv6 packets. Rules for both L3 protocols affect both.</br>Use `meta l4proto` to match on the L4 protocol, regardless of whether is IPv4 or IPv6.| |
